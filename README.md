Exploring Apple HealthKit data access and analysis

## What is HKAnalyser

Currently vaporware.  I'm exploring what correlations can be made between various sample types.  

## Motivation

I've had little success getting 3 years of Health data off the device, as all apps I've tried, including the Apple Health App, 
seem to crash with anything other than limited time period and long intervals.  I'd really like the raw data,
and then be able to analyse it on a PC/cloud so that I can look for trends.

I had a stroke 2 years ago, and I'm aware of some anecdoctal correlation between activity, heart rate and sleep patterns,
and poking into the data I've collected before and since might show me something useful.

NB: My health is fine now, the stroke had no lasting effects, and in fact seems to have helped in some areas, or maybe
that just my change in attitude since, although it should be noted that I was by many metrics 'fitter' before the stroke.
I've actually taken it easier since (not that I was ever a gym-bunny or fitness freak).
